# Mag_Isol_Numerical
This repository provides Python code for numerically solving boundary value problems and generating bifurcation plots related to magnetic isolation in vacuum diodes. It supports the analysis of electron dynamics under magnetic confinement, focusing on how varying field strengths affect current flow, stability, and system bifurcations.
